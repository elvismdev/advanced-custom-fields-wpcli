== Installation ==

**Requirements**

* Advanced Custom Fields plugin
* `wp-cli` http://wp-cli.org/

**How to install**

1. install `wp-cli` http://wp-cli.org/
2. clone this repo as `advanced-custom-fields-wpcli` in your plugins directory
3. activate `advanced-custom-fields-wpcli` plugin through "wp plugin activate advanced-custom-fields-wpcli" (or activate in the plugin menu)
4. open a terminal and go to your wordpress directory
5. type `wp` (and see the `acf` commands if installed correctly)
6. type `wp acf` to test the `acf-wpcli` extension
7. start using the commands as explained in "Commands"

When the plugin is enabled, any exported field groups found on the filesystem in your registered paths will be added to Wordpress at runtime.

If you would like to disable this behaviour you can remove the `acf_wpcli_register_groups` action:
`
remove_action('plugins_loaded', 'acf_wpcli_register_groups');
`
